# Colour-app


This Kotlin application is a color management app developed using the MVVM architecture and Jetpack Compose for the UI. The app displays a list of colors in four rows with two colors in each row, where each color box shows its corresponding color code. RoomDB is used for local offline storage, while Firebase is integrated for syncing color data to the cloud. The UI components, including color boxes, are styled according to specific dimensions, typography, and layout requirements. Users can add new colors and sync them to the cloud with just a tap, ensuring seamless data management.
